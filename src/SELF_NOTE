##### A. How project was set up info #####
  * Creating Project:
      1) Navigate to folder for desired location of project.
      2) Open terminal
      3) Enter command below:
        ng new [project_name]

  * Creating Component:
      1) Navigate to [project_name] directory
      2) In app folder, create directory called "components" (This is just for organization, so all our components are in one place)
      2) Enter command below:
        ng g component components/[componentName] //We created a folder called "components" in app folder
      //This handles the import and declaration so you don't have to do manually

  * Creating Service:
      1) Similar to "Creating Component" steps above, but instead use:
        ng g service services/[serviceName] //We created a folder called "services" in app folder
      2) Add it to app.module.ts:
        i) Add following two lines:
          import { CalculationService } from './services/calculation.service';
          ...
          providers: [CalculationService],
          ...
      3) Then to use, go to your component, import it, and then add the dependency into the constructor

  * Creating Router: // https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6ipgij-AUw
      1) Similar to aboves. Add following to app.modules.ts: //Note import requires an array in argument
        import { RouterModule} from '@angular/router';
        ...
        imports: [
            ..., RouterModule.forRoot([
              {
                path: 'ebay_profit',
                component: EbayProfitComponent
              },
              ...//Add other components
            ])
        ...

  * Including bootstrap:
      1) Follow https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/stories-include-bootstrap#include-bootstrap

  * Allowing two-way binding:
      1) Enter do following in app.module.ts:
        i) import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms'; //Place in top
        ii) Place "FormsModule" in imports
          ex)
              @NgModule({
                  imports: [
                    BrowserModule,
                    FormsModule
                  ],
                  ...
              })
